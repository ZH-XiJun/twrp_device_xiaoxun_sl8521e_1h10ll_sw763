Jump to [here](https://github.com/ZH-XiJun/Action-TWRP-Builder/releases) and find out the device `sl8521e_1h10ll_sw763`.

Some devices have two or more releases. Pls make sure you have downloaded the latest release. 

If the device cannot be found, that means I haven't built it yet or I failed to build it. Please build it by yourself.

## Build

Pls use my fork of [Action TWRP builder](https://github.com/zh-xijun/Action-TWRP-Builder) and choose "Recovery Build (Ubuntu 18.04)" to build TWRP since this device uses twrp-5.1 source.
